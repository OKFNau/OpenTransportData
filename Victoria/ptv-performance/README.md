## PTV punctuality, reliability, patronage and customer satisfaction data

Data in these directories is derived from tables published at http://ptv.vic.gov.au/about-ptv/ptv-data-and-reports/track-record-2/ and assumed to be Creative Commons 3.0.

Please see that page for footnotes, particularly for annual patronage data. Especially important:

> Patronage estimates for the three metropolitan modes were estimated using a different methodology from 2004-05. This change in methodology means a step-change in patronage estimates from 2003-04 to 2004-05 for train and tram and 2004-05 to 2005-06 for bus. This needs to be considered when comparing estimates across years.

There is currently no process to keep the data in this repository up to date with published figures.
